# QA Candidate Assignment

Implement a UI test that goes through our [sales funnel]. Your test should stop when you have to enter your birth date (*Wann wurdest du geboren?*).

## Requirements
We ask that your test will pick at least three different car brands, each brand with three different cars.

## Considerations
- Make it easy to build and run, do also consider maintainability
- Think of further scenarios (e.g. negative)
- Think of further requirements (e.g. cross-browser)
- Don't be afraid to surprise us!

#### Technologies to pick from
| Technology    | Stack                         |
|---------------| :-----------------------------|
| Build tool    | [Maven] / [Gradle] / [yarn]          |
| Language      | [Java] / [Groovy] / [Typescript] (js)  |   
| UI technology | [Selenium] / [Geb] / [WebdriverIO]   |
| Test framework| [Junit 5] / [TestNG] / [Spock] / [Mocha]            |
